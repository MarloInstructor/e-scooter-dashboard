    """
    Welcome to the **E-Scooter Demand & Forecasting Dashboard** ‚Äì your one-stop solution for exploring,
    understanding, and planning shared mobility operations. This interactive platform consolidates 
    historical usage data, location-based demand patterns, and forecasting tools to help you make 
    data-driven decisions on fleet distribution, infrastructure investments, and operational strategies.
    
    **Key Capabilities**:
    - Explore historical ridership trends
    - Visualize real-time and historical location-based demand
    - Forecast future usage based on weather and event inputs
    - Identify optimal spots for scooter deployment and rebalancing

    """
    **Navigation**: Use the **sidebar** to move between different sections of the dashboard. 
    On mobile devices, tap the ‚ò∞ icon in the top-left to access the sidebar.

    Within each section, you may find filters (e.g., dates, regions, weather parameters) to 
    refine your view. Adjust these controls to explore specific scenarios or timeframes.

st.markdown(
    """
    - **Historical Dashboard**  
      Analyze past ridership data by month, day, or hour. Overlay weather conditions 
      and special events to see how external factors shape demand.

    - **Temporal Scenario Deck**  
      Create custom forecasts based on calendar inputs (day of week, month, hour) 
      and weather conditions (temperature, rain, snow, wind). Visualize how changes 
      in these factors might affect hourly trip counts.

    - **Spatial Trip Deck**  
      Explore pickup and dropoff clusters on an interactive map. Identify hotspots, 
      visualize capacity constraints, and detect patterns across different neighborhoods.

    - **Spatial Demand Deck**  
      Zoom into high-demand zones for rebalancing and resource planning. Discover 
      which areas consistently see peak usage and strategize daily scooter deployment.

    - **Space-to-Space Deck**  
      View origin-destination flows between hex regions in 3D or 2D KeplerGL maps. 
      A great tool for seeing how riders move throughout the city, highlighting 
      corridors of high traffic or under-served connections.
